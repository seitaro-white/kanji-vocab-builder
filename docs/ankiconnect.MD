Title: ~foosoft/anki-connect - Anki plugin to expose a remote API for creating flash cards - sourcehut git

URL Source: https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect

Markdown Content:
Anki-Connect enables external applications such as Yomichan to communicate with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) over a simple HTTP API. Its capabilities include executing queries against the user's card deck, automatically creating new cards, and more. Anki-Connect is compatible with the latest stable (2.1.x) releases of Anki; older versions (2.0.x and below) are no longer supported.

### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#installation)Installation

The installation process is similar to other Anki plugins and can be accomplished in three steps:

1.  Open the `Install Add-on` dialog by selecting `Tools` | `Add-ons` | `Get Add-ons...` in Anki.
2.  Input [2055492159](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) into the text box labeled `Code` and press the `OK` button to proceed.
3.  Restart Anki when prompted to do so in order to complete the installation of Anki-Connect.

Anki must be kept running in the background in order for other applications to be able to use Anki-Connect. You can verify that Anki-Connect is running at any time by accessing `localhost:8765` in your browser. If the server is running, you will see the message `Anki-Connect` displayed in your browser window.

#### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#notes-for-windows-users)Notes for Windows Users

Windows users may see a firewall nag dialog box appear on Anki startup. This occurs because Anki-Connect runs a local HTTP server in order to enable other applications to connect to it. The host application, Anki, must be unblocked for this plugin to function correctly.

#### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#notes-for-macos-users)Notes for MacOS Users

Starting with [Mac OS X Mavericks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Mavericks), a feature named _App Nap_ has been introduced to the operating system. This feature causes certain applications which are open (but not visible) to be placed in a suspended state. As this behavior causes Anki-Connect to stop working while you have another window in the foreground, App Nap should be disabled for Anki:

1.  Start the Terminal application.
2.  Execute the following commands in the terminal window:

    defaults write net.ankiweb.dtop NSAppSleepDisabled \-bool true
    defaults write net.ichi2.anki NSAppSleepDisabled \-bool true
    defaults write org.qt-project.Qt.QtWebEngineCore NSAppSleepDisabled \-bool true

3.  Restart Anki.

### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#application-interface-for-developers)Application Interface for Developers

Anki-Connect exposes internal Anki features to external applications via an easy to use API. After being installed, this plugin will start an HTTP server on port 8765 whenever Anki is launched. Other applications (including browser extensions) can then communicate with it via HTTP requests.

By default, Anki-Connect will only bind the HTTP server to the `127.0.0.1` IP address, so that you will only be able to access it from the same host on which it is running. If you need to access it over a network, you can change the binding address in the configuration. Go to Tools-\>Add-ons-\>AnkiConnect-\>Config and change the "webBindAddress" value. For example, you can set it to `0.0.0.0` in order to bind it to all network interfaces on your host. This also requires a restart for Anki.

#### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#sample-invocation)Sample Invocation

Every request consists of a JSON-encoded object containing an `action`, a `version`, contextual `params`, and a `key` value used for authentication (which is optional and can be omitted by default). Anki-Connect will respond with an object containing two fields: `result` and `error`. The `result` field contains the return value of the executed API, and the `error` field is a description of any exception thrown during API execution (the value `null` is used if execution completed successfully).

_Sample successful response_:

{"result": \["Default", "Filtered Deck 1"\], "error": null}

_Samples of failed responses_:

{"result": null, "error": "unsupported action"}

{"result": null, "error": "guiBrowse() got an unexpected keyword argument 'foobar'"}

For compatibility with clients designed to work with older versions of Anki-Connect, failing to provide a `version` field in the request will make the version default to 4. Furthermore, when the provided version is level 4 or below, the API response will only contain the value of the `result`; no `error` field is available for error handling.

You can use whatever language or tool you like to issue request to Anki-Connect, but a couple of simple examples are included below as reference.

#### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#authentication)Authentication

Anki-Connect supports requiring authentication in order to make API requests. This support is _disabled_ by default, but can be enabled by setting the `apiKey` field of Anki-Config's settings (Tools-\>Add-ons-\>AnkiConnect-\>Config) to a desired string. If you have done so, you should see the [`requestPermission`](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#requestpermission) API request return `true` for `requireApiKey`. You then must include an additional parameter called `key` in any further API request bodies, whose value must match the configured API key.

#### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#hey-could-you-add-a-new-action-to-support-feature)Hey, could you add a new action to support $FEATURE?

The primary goal for Anki-Connect was to support real-time flash card creation from the Yomichan browser extension. The current API provides all the required actions to make this happen. I recognise that the role of Anki-Connect has evolved from this original vision, and I am happy to review new feature requests.

With that said, _this project operates on a self-serve model_. If you would like a new feature, create a PR. I'll review it and if it looks good, it will be merged in. _Requests to add new features without accompanying pull requests will not be serviced_. Make sure that your pull request meets the following criteria:

*   Attempt to match style of the surrounding code.
*   Have accompanying documentation with examples.
*   Have accompanying tests that verify operation.
*   Implement features useful in other applications.

### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#supported-actions)Supported Actions

Documentation for currently supported actions is split up by category and is referenced below. Note that deprecated APIs will continue to function despite not being listed on this page as long as your request is labeled with a version number corresponding to when the API was available for use. Search parameters are passed to Anki, check the docs for more information: [https://docs.ankiweb.net/searching.html](https://docs.ankiweb.net/searching.html)

##### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#codegeteasefactorscode)`getEaseFactors`

*   Returns an array with the ease factor for each of the given cards (in the same order).

    _Sample request:_

    {
        "action": "getEaseFactors",
        "version": 6,
        "params": {
            "cards": \[1483959291685, 1483959293217\]
        }
    }
    _Sample result:_

    {
        "result": \[4100, 3900\],
        "error": null
    }


##### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#codeseteasefactorscode)`setEaseFactors`

*   Sets ease factor of cards by card ID; returns `true` if successful (all cards existed) or `false` otherwise.

    _Sample request:_

    {
        "action": "setEaseFactors",
        "version": 6,
        "params": {
            "cards": \[1483959291685, 1483959293217\],
            "easeFactors": \[4100, 3900\]
        }
    }
    _Sample result:_

    {
        "result": \[true, true\],
        "error": null
    }


##### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#codesetspecificvalueofcardcode)`setSpecificValueOfCard`

*   Sets specific value of a single card. Given the risk of wreaking havor in the database when changing some of the values of a card, some of the keys require the argument "warning\_check" set to True. This can be used to set a card's flag, change it's ease factor, change the review order in a filtered deck and change the column "data" (not currently used by anki apparantly), and many other values. A list of values and explanation of their respective utility can be found at [AnkiDroid's wiki](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Database-Structure).

    _Sample request:_

    {
        "action": "setSpecificValueOfCard",
        "version": 6,

            "card": 1483959291685,
            "keys": \["flags", "odue"\],
            "newValues": \["1", "-100"\]
        }
    }
    _Sample result:_

    {
        "result": \[true, true\],
        "error": null
    }


##### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#codesuspendcode)`suspend`

*   Suspend cards by card ID; returns `true` if successful (at least one card wasn't already suspended) or `false` otherwise.

    _Sample request:_

    {
        "action": "suspend",
        "version": 6,
        "params": {
            "cards": \[1483959291685, 1483959293217\]
        }

        "error": null
    }


##### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#codeunsuspendcode)`unsuspend`

    _Sample request:_

    {
        "action": "unsuspend",
        "version": 6,
        "params": {
            "cards": \[1483959291685, 1483959293217\]
        }

        "error": null
    }


##### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#codesuspendedcode)`suspended`

*   Check if card is suspended by its ID. Returns `true` if suspended, `false` otherwise.

    _Sample request:_

    {
        "action": "suspended",
        "version": 6,
        "params": {
            "card": 1483959293217
        }
    }
    _Sample result:_

    {
        "result": true,
        "error": null
    }


##### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#codearesuspendedcode)`areSuspended`

*   Returns an array indicating whether each of the given cards is suspended (in the same order). If card doesn't exist returns `null`.

    }


##### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#codeareduecode)`areDue`

*   Returns an array indicating whether each of the given cards is due (in the same order). _Note_: cards in the learning queue with a large interval (over 20 minutes) are treated as not due until the time of their interval has passed, to match the way Anki treats them when reviewing.

    _Sample request:_

    {
        "action": "areDue",
        "version": 6,
        "params": {
            "cards": \[1483959291685, 1483959293217\]

        "error": null
    }


##### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#codefindcardscode)`findCards`

*   Returns an array of card IDs for a given query. Functionally identical to `guiBrowse` but doesn't use the GUI for better performance.

    _Sample request:_

    {
        "action": "findCards",
        "version": 6,
        "params": {

    Optionally, the `reorderCards` property can be provided to reorder the cards shown in the _Card Browser_. This is an array including the `order` and `columnId` objects. `order` can be either `ascending` or `descending` while `columnId` can be one of several column identifiers (as documented in the [Anki source code](https://github.com/ankitects/anki/blob/main/rslib/src/browser_table.rs)). The specified column needs to be visible in the _Card Browser_.

#### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#media-actions)Media Actions

##### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#codestoremediafilecode)`storeMediaFile`

*   Stores a file with the specified base64-encoded contents inside the media folder. Alternatively you can specify a absolute file path, or a url from where the file shell be downloaded. If more than one of `data`, `path` and `url` are provided, the `data` field will be used first, then `path`, and finally `url`. To prevent Anki from removing files not used by any cards (e.g. for configuration files), prefix the filename with an underscore. These files are still synchronized to AnkiWeb. Any existing file with the same name is deleted by default. Set `deleteExisting` to false to prevent that by [letting Anki give the new file a non-conflicting name](https://github.com/ankitects/anki/blob/aeba725d3ea9628c73300648f748140db3fdd5ed/rslib/src/media/files.rs#L194).

#### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#miscellaneous-actions)Miscellaneous Actions

##### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#coderequestpermissioncode)`requestPermission`

*   Requests permission to use the API exposed by this plugin. This method does not require the API key, and is the only one that accepts requests from any origin; the other methods only accept requests from trusted origins, which are listed under `webCorsOriginList` in the add-on config. `localhost` is trusted by default.

    Calling this method from an untrusted origin will display a popup in Anki asking the user whether they want to allow your origin to use the API; calls from trusted origins will return the result without displaying the popup. When denying permission, the user may also choose to ignore further permission requests from that origin. These origins end up in the `ignoreOriginList`, editable via the add-on config.

    The result always contains the `permission` field, which in turn contains either the string `granted` or `denied`, corresponding to whether your origin is trusted. If your origin is trusted, the fields `requireApiKey` (`true` if required) and `version` will also be returned.

    This should be the first call you make to make sure that your application and Anki-Connect are able to communicate properly with each other. New versions of Anki-Connect are backwards compatible; as long as you are using actions which are available in the reported Anki-Connect version or earlier, everything should work fine.

    _Sample request:_

    {
        "action": "requestPermission",
        "version": 6
    }
    _Sample results:_

    {

            "requireApiKey": false,
            "version": 6
        },

##### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#codeapireflectcode)`apiReflect`

    *   `scopes` - An array of scopes to get reflection information about. The only currently supported value is `"actions"`.
    *   `actions` - Either `null` or an array of API method names to check for. If the value is `null`, the result will list all of the available API actions. If the value is an array of strings, the result will only contain actions which were in this array.

    The result will contain a list of which scopes were used and a value for each scope. For example, the `"actions"` scope will contain a `"actions"` property which contains a list of supported action names.

    _Sample request:_

    {
        "action": "apiReflect",
        "version": 6,
        "params": {

#### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#note-actions)Note Actions

##### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#codeaddnotecode)`addNote`

*   Creates a note using the given deck and model, with the provided field values and tags. Returns the identifier of the created note created on success, and `null` on failure.

    Anki-Connect can download audio, video, and picture files and embed them in newly created notes. The corresponding `audio`, `video`, and `picture` note members are optional and can be omitted. If you choose to include any of them, they should contain a single object or an array of objects with the mandatory `filename` field and one of `data`, `path` or `url`. Refer to the documentation of `storeMediaFile` for an explanation of these fields. The `skipHash` field can be optionally provided to skip the inclusion of files with an MD5 hash that matches the provided value. This is useful for avoiding the saving of error pages and stub files. The `fields` member is a list of fields that should play audio or video, or show a picture when the card is displayed in Anki. The `allowDuplicate` member inside `options` group can be set to true to enable adding duplicate cards. Normally duplicate cards can not be added and trigger exception.

    The `duplicateScope` member inside `options` can be used to specify the scope for which duplicates are checked. A value of `"deck"` will only check for duplicates in the target deck; any other value will check the entire collection.

    The `duplicateScopeOptions` object can be used to specify some additional settings:

    *   `duplicateScopeOptions.deckName` will specify which deck to use for checking duplicates in. If undefined or `null`, the target deck will be used.
    *   `duplicateScopeOptions.checkChildren` will change whether or not duplicate cards are checked in child decks. The default value is `false`.
    *   `duplicateScopeOptions.checkAllModels` specifies whether duplicate checks are performed across all note types. The default value is `false`.

    > **Warning**: You must not be viewing the note that you are updating on your Anki browser, otherwise the fields will not update. See [this issue](https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect/issues/82) for further details.

##### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#codeupdatenotecode)`updateNote`

*   Modify the fields and/or tags of an existing note. In other words, combines `updateNoteFields` and `updateNoteTags`. Please see their documentation for an explanation of all properties.

    Either `fields` or `tags` property can be omitted without affecting the other. Thus valid requests to `updateNoteFields` also work with `updateNote`. The note must have the `fields` property in order to update the optional audio, video, or picture objects.

    If neither `fields` nor `tags` are provided, the method will fail. Fields are updated first and are not rolled back if updating tags fails. Tags are not updated if updating fields fails.

    > **Warning** You must not be viewing the note that you are updating on your Anki browser, otherwise the fields will not update. See [this issue](https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect/issues/82) for further details.

##### [#](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect#codegetreviewsofcardscode)`getReviewsOfCards`

*   Requests all card reviews for each card ID. Returns a dictionary mapping each card ID to a list of dictionaries of the format:

    ```
    {
        "id": reviewTime,
        "usn": usn,
        "ease": buttonPressed,
        "ivl": newInterval,
        "lastIvl": previousInterval,
        "factor": newFactor,
        "time": reviewDuration,
        "type": reviewType,
    }
    ```

    The reason why these key values are used instead of the more descriptive counterparts is because these are the exact key values used in Anki's database.
